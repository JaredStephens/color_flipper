# Color Flipper
## Overview ##
This web aplication is a simple color flipper, clicking the button will change the background to a random color, as well as display the name of the random color on the page.
It was build using HTML, CSS, and Vanilla JavaScript, I built this project to get more practice using JavaScript. <br> This helped me practice and improve my JS skills, including Arrays, working with the DOM, and event listeners.
I am currently going through the Team Tree House TechDegree, while there are quality projects at the end of each unit I want to work on as many projects as I can to increase my skills. <br>
This project comes from the FreeCodeCamp artical **"40 JavaScript Projects for Beginners â€“ Easy Ideas to Get Started Coding JS"** <br>
